## filter.c
This is the C implemention of matlab filter function

## fft.c
This abstracts the ```fftwf_plan_dft_1d``` inteface of [ FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/)
 
## Dependence
The ```fft.c``` require
[ FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) library.


## Test case
The performance of filter.c is better than matlab.  
The exact test case stay tuned.
